            HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE
        </h2>

        <p class="castle">
            Howl's moving castle follows the story of a girl named sophie. She is a needlewoman for her family's hat shop. After visiting her sister she encounters Howl, a mysterious wizard, this angers the witch of the waste and she gets turned into a 90-year-old woman. Now Sophie needs to find a way to break the curse without being able to tell anyone. On her journey she comes across a variety of strange new things such as a living scarecrow, whom she calls turnip head. He leads her to howl's moving castle. Where she meets Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer. Here she starts working as a cleaning lady for Howl.

            Howl gets summoned by the king to fight in the war that's starting in their country. He gets Sophie to pretend to be his mother and confront the king to tell him Howl can't contribute any help. Sulliman, a woman who works for the king, figures out the lie and turns Howl into his monterous form. So now sophie has to find a way to help him.

            The movie is based on the 1986 novel written by Diana Wynne Jones. The first half of the movie follows the same story as the novel, but the second half is totally different. Even though Diana didn't want for miyazaki to change it, she does approve of the movie adaption.

            Howl's moving castle has got to be one of my favourite movies to ever exist. I really love the meaning behind it. Both Sophie and Howl learn to accept themselves while also falling in love with each other. I also really like Sophie's character she's very empathetic and selfless and she was able to find herself. In the beginning she felt like she was useless and undeserving of love, but when she broke out of that mindset she was able to break the curse and help Howl. Also the visuals are stunning and the animation is just so well done.
