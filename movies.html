                HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE
            </h2>

            <p>
                Howl's moving castle follows the story of a girl named sophie. She is a needlewoman for her family's hat shop. After visiting her sister she encounters Howl, a mysterious wizard, this angers the witch of the waste and she gets turned into a 90-year-old woman. Now Sophie needs to find a way to break the curse without being able to tell anyone. On her journey she comes across a variety of strange new things such as a living scarecrow, whom she calls turnip head. He leads her to howl's moving castle. Where she meets Markl and a fire demon named Calcifer. Here she starts working as a cleaning lady for Howl.

                Howl gets summoned by the king to fight in the war that's starting in their country. He gets Sophie to pretend to be his mother and confront the king to tell him Howl can't contribute any help. Sulliman, a woman who works for the king, figures out the lie and turns Howl into his monterous form. So now sophie has to find a way to help him.

                The movie is based on the 1986 novel written by Diana Wynne Jones. The first half of the movie follows the same story as the novel, but the second half is totally different. Even though Diana didn't want for miyazaki to change it, she does approve of the movie adaption. 

                <br><br>

                Howl's moving castle has got to be one of my favourite movies to ever exist. I really love the meaning behind it. Both Sophie and Howl learn to accept themselves while also falling in love with each other. I also really like Sophie's character she's very empathetic and selfless and she was able to find herself. In the beginning she felt like she was useless and undeserving of love, but when she broke out of that mindset she was able to break the curse and help Howl. Also the visuals are stunning and the animation is just so well done.

                SPIRITED AWAY
            </h2>

            <p>
                Chihiro and her parents are moving to a small Japanese town in the countryside, much to Chihiro's dismay. On the way to their new home, Chihiro's father makes a wrong turn and drives down a lonely one-lane road which dead-ends in front of a tunnel. Her parents decide to stop the car and explore the area. They go through the tunnel and find an abandoned amusement park on the other side, with its own little town. When her parents see a restaurant with great-smelling food but no staff, they decide to eat and pay later. However, Chihiro refuses to eat and decides to explore the theme park a bit more. She meets a boy named Haku who tells her that Chihiro and her parents are in danger, and they must leave immediately. She runs to the restaurant and finds that her parents have turned into pigs. In addition, the theme park turns out to be a town inhabited by demons, spirits, and evil gods. At the center of the town is a bathhouse where these creatures go to relax. The owner of the bathhouse is the evil witch Yubaba, who is intent on keeping all trespassers as captive workers, including Chihiro. Chihiro must rely on Haku to save her parents in hopes of returning to their world. <br><br>

                Spirited away is an absolutely captivating movie. One that i think everyone should see at least once in their life. The whole storyline keeps you interested and even though it's a fantasy movie Chihiro, the main character, still acts like a child which you don't see often in movies. I think she's incredibly well written. I saw someone say this about Studio Ghibli's movies, there's no clear good vs evil dichotomy in these movies. There's no actual villain and hero which makes this movie feel so realistic to me. Also the fact that it's all animated by hand is just so impressive to me. Even though it's not my favourite i can definitely see why it is for a lot of people.

            <h2>
                MY NEIGHBOUR TOTORO
            </h2>

            <p>
                The movie My Neighbour Totoro is about two sisters, Satsuki and Mei, who move with their Dad to a house in the countryside. Their new neighbour happens to be a spiritual tree guardian, Totoro.

                When the family arrive they see their new house for the first time. It looks very rundown and has a neglected feeling around it. But the sisters don't mind at all, they think that it is the best thing in the world. Satsuki and Mei are super excited to explore the house. When they enter the kitchen they become aware that it is full of small fuzzy black things called dustbunnies (for more info see my characters page)
                
                One day while playing outside Mei spots a pair of white ears in the long grass. These ears belong to a small white Totoro. She follows the Totoro under the house and then in to the forest. Mei ends up at a massive tree in the middle of the forest. This tree is called a camphor tree; it is the home of the large Totoro.
                
                Mei tumbles down a hole at the base of the tree and ends up in Totoro's den. She climbs on top of the big Totoro and falls asleep. When Satsuki gets home from school she asks her Dad where Mei is but he doesn't know. Satsuki finds Mei's hat at the edge of the forest, Satsuki goes a little way in to the forest and finds Mei asleep in a clearing. The Totoro is nowhere to be seen.
                
                One day Satsuki and Mei's Dad had to work late. Satsuki and Mei have just walked home and it is pouring with rain. Their Dad has forgotten to take his umbrella with him to work. Satsuki and Mei decide to walk down to the bus stop with an umbrella to wait for him. While they are waiting the most peculiar thing happens, the big Totoro comes up and stands next to them. Satsuki is amazed, she also realises the Totoro doesn't have an umbrella and offers him their Dad's umbrella, Totoro accepts thankfully. In return he gives them a pouch of nuts and seeds. When their Dad's bus finally arrives Satsuki is really excited to tell her Dad that she saw the big Totoro for the first time. <br><br>

                My neighbour totoro is so different from spirited away. It's much more lighthearted and it's the type of movie that i enjoy watching when it's raining outside with a cup of hot chocolate milk. And the soundtrack is so good. Even though not a lot of things happen in this movie it is the most imaginative movie of all of them in my opinion and it fits the movie incredibly well. It really adds to the nostalgia element which i think is the reason why most people love this so much. I also think the relationship between the two sisters is so adorable and it reminds me of how my sister and I used to be when we were children.
